 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * JACOB, https://github.com/nbatfai/jacob
 *
 * "The son of Isaac is Jacob." The project called Jacob is an experiment
 * to replace Isaac's (GUI based) visual imagination with a character console.
 *
 * ISAAC, https://github.com/nbatfai/isaac
 *
 * "The son of Samu is Isaac." The project called Isaac is a case study
 * of using deep Q learning with neural networks for predicting the next
 * sentence of a conversation.
 *
 * SAMU, https://github.com/nbatfai/samu
 *
 * The main purpose of this project is to allow the evaluation and
 * verification of the results of the paper entitled "A disembodied
 * developmental robotic agent called Samu Bátfai". It is our hope
 * that Samu will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter
 * bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.
